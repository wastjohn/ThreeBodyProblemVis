\subsection{The Three Body Problem}
The Three Body Problem is a simplified version of the $n$-body problem, which is the problem of finding the motion of $n$ bodies interacting with each other through gravitational forces. The Three Body Problem is the special case of $n=3$. The Three Body Problem is a special case because it is the simplest case where the motion of the bodies cannot be solved analytically. The Three Body Problem is also interesting because it is the simplest case where the motion of the bodies is chaotic.
